Petersons solution for two processes uses boolean flags of 0 or 1 for allowing two processes to access the same resource without conflict. 
When there are more than two processes we can no longer use the boolean method and instead must use an integer array of N-1 variables each representing a distinct "waiting room" before the critical section.
Processes advance from one room to the next and finish in room N−1 which is the critical section. 
This process works so that even if all N processes were to enter waiting room zero at the same time, no more than N−1 will proceed to the next room.
