4ghz = 4,000,000,000 cycles per second

1 second = 1,000,000,000 nanoseconds

4 clock cycles per nanosecond

light goes .2997 meters per nanosecond which is 11.8 inches per nanosecond 
and 85% of that is: 11.8 *.85 = 10.03 inches per nanosecond

10in = 1ns
and
1cycle = 1/4ns

so

10in / 4ns = 2.5 inches (or 0.0635 meters)
